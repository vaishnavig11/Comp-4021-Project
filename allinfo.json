For upper division courses, they need instructor approval to receive access to the course. \n Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment: If there are a large number of open seats, students will be allowed to enroll in courses for which they meet prerequisites. If there are very few seats available, advisors will wait until 1-2 weeks before the start of the semester before giving permission for exchange students to enroll. \n Engineering of Matter, Transport, and Energy: After all registration has opened, students will be given overrides into courses that still have a lot of seats open. If there are 10 or less seats available, advisors will wait until 1-2 weeks before the start of the semester before giving permission for exchange students to enroll. \n Students cannot take Journalism (JMC) courses at ASU.
